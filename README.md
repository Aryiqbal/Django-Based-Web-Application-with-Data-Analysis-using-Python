Django-Based Web Application with Data Analysis

Project Description

This project combines a Django-based web application with data analysis functionalities using Python. The web application provides a framework for managing pages and accounts, while data analysis, including ARIMA modeling, is performed for forecasting and insights.

Technologies Used

Django: Backend framework for managing user accounts, database interactions, and serving web pages.
Python: Used for data analysis and machine learning with the ARIMA model.
SQLite: Database for storing user and application data.
Features

Django Web Application:
User account management.
Page rendering and routing.
Data Analysis:
ARIMA Model for time series forecasting.
Data processing and visualization via Jupyter Notebooks.
